<h1><a name="THE_TALE_OF_RUSTY_WREN" id="THE_TALE_OF_RUSTY_WREN"></a>THE TALE OF RUSTY WREN</h1>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h2>

<h2>A PLEASANT HOME</h2>


<p>Now, Rusty Wren had found&mdash;and shown
to his wife&mdash;a hollow apple tree and a hole
in a fence-rail, either of which he thought
would make a pleasant place in which to
live.</p>

<p>But since the little couple were <i>house
wrens</i>, Rusty&rsquo;s wife said she thought that
they oughtn&rsquo;t to be so far from the farmhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not build our nest behind one of
the shutters?&rdquo; she suggested.</p>

<p>But Rusty shook his head quickly&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Somebody
might come to the window and close the
shutter; and then our nest would fall to
the ground. And if we happened to have
six or eight eggs in it, you know you
wouldn&rsquo;t like that very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty&rsquo;s wife agreed with him on that
point. But she still insisted that she
wanted to live near the farmhouse; and
she said that she expected her husband to
find a good spot for their nest, for she certainly
wasn&rsquo;t going to spend the summer
in a hole in a fence-rail, or in an old apple
tree, either.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren saw at once that there was
no sense in arguing with her. If he wanted
any peace, he knew that he might as well
forget the old hollow apple tree and the
hole in the fence-rail too. He had better
forget them and resume his search for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
home. So he gave his plump little cinnamon-colored
body a shake and held his
tail at even a higher angle than usual,
just to show people that he was going to
be the head of the house&mdash;when they
should have one. Then with a flirt of his
short, round wings he hurried over to Farmer
Green&rsquo;s dooryard&mdash;after calling to
his wife that he would come back and tell
her if he had any luck.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren spent some busy moments
about Farmer Green&rsquo;s buildings. And
since he loved to be busy and was never
so happy as when he had something important
to do, he hopped and climbed and
fluttered to his heart&rsquo;s content, looking
into a hundred different holes and cracks
and crannies.</p>

<p>But he didn&rsquo;t find a single one that
suited him. Every place into which he
peered was either too big or too little, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
too high or too low; or it was where the
rain would beat upon it; or maybe it was
so situated that the cat could thrust her
paw inside. Anyhow, every possible nook
for a nest had some drawback. And Rusty
was wondering what he could say to his
wife, who was sure to be upset if her plans
went wrong, when all at once he came
upon the finest place for a house that he
had ever seen. One quick look through
the small round opening that led to it was
enough.</p>

<p>He knew right away that his search was
ended. So he hurried back to the orchard
to find Mrs. Rusty and tell her the good
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the best spot for a house
in all Pleasant Valley!&rdquo; he cried, as he
dropped down beside her and hopped
about in his excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it in a good neighborhood?&rdquo; she inquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in a
tree close to Farmer Green&rsquo;s bedroom
window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hole in a tree!&rdquo; she exclaimed somewhat
doubtfully. &ldquo;Not an old squirrel&rsquo;s
nest, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
really <i>in</i> a tree. It&rsquo;s nailed to a tree.
Come with me and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the bustling little pair hastened
toward the farmhouse. And, to Rusty&rsquo;s
delight, the moment his wife saw what he
had found she said at once that it was exactly
the sort of house she had always
hoped to have, some time.</p>

<h2>JOHNNIE GREEN&rsquo;S IDEA</h2>


<p>It happened that just before Rusty Wren
and his wife came to Pleasant Valley to
look for a home, Johnnie Green had an
idea.</p>

<p>He found the idea in the weekly paper
which the letter-carrier left each Friday
in the mail box at the crossroads. On the
Children&rsquo;s Page Johnnie read a story
about a pair of house wrens. And he
learned then that an old tin can nailed to
a tree makes exactly the sort of house that
wrens like.</p>

<p>Well, Johnnie Green began at once to
look for a tin can. He had made up his
mind that he would try to coax a couple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of those busy little songsters to nest near-by,
where he could have fun watching
them.</p>

<p>Not finding an <i>old</i> tin can that suited
him, Johnnie took a shiny maple syrup
can, which his father said he might have.
It seemed to him that it was just the kind
he needed, for the only opening in it was
a small round hole in the top, hardly bigger
than a twenty-five-cent piece. (The
story in the weekly paper said that the
wrens&rsquo; doorway should be as small as that,
so that no ruffianly English sparrows
could enter the house and disturb the little
people that were to dwell there.)</p>

<p>Johnnie Green punched a few nail holes
in the sides of the syrup can, because he
thought that if <i>he</i> lived in such a place,
he would want plenty of fresh air. Then
he nailed a board to the can. And next
he nailed the board to a cherry tree close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to the house.</p>

<p>After that Johnnie had nothing more
to do but wait. And he had not waited
two days before Rusty Wren discovered
the bright tin can that was to be his summer
home.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw it, Rusty&rsquo;s wife said
that there must be kind people living in
the farmhouse, or they never would have
driven nails through a spick-and-span can
just to make strangers happy.</p>

<p>Since their search was ended, the tiny
pair began building their nest right then
and there. In a surprisingly short time
they had completely filled their new house
with twigs. And as soon as they had done
that much, in the center of the mass of
twigs they built a nest of dried grasses,
singing the merriest of songs while they
worked.</p>

<p>Of course, Johnnie Green was delighted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
All the time the lively little
couple were at work upon their new home
it was easy to find Johnnie. But it was
hard to get him to do any errands, because
he didn&rsquo;t want to stir from the dooryard,
he was so interested in what was
going on.</p>

<p>Farmer Green, too, seemed pleased.
And though he didn&rsquo;t spend much time
watching Mr. and Mrs. Rusty (he said
that he had to work, the same as they), he
remarked to Johnnie that he was glad to
see that the newcomers were already paying
rent for their house.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rent?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just hear them!&rdquo; his father replied.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t their singing pay enough for the
use of a tin syrup can?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; cried Johnnie. &ldquo;I never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
thought of that. Why, they&rsquo;ve turned
that can into a regular music-box!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE ALARM CLOCK</h2>


<p>All summer long Farmer Green rose
while the world was still gray, before the
sun climbed over the mountain to flood
Pleasant Valley with his golden light.</p>

<p>One might think that Farmer Green
would have had some trouble awaking so
early in the morning. And perhaps he
might have overslept now and then had
he not had a never-failing alarm clock to
arouse him.</p>

<p>It was not one of those man-made
clocks, which go off with a deafening clatter
and bring a startled body to his feet
before he is really awake. No! Farmer
Green had something much pleasanter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
than that; and it was not in his bedroom,
either.</p>

<p>His alarm clock was in his dooryard,
for it was Rusty Wren himself who always
warned him that day was breaking
and that it was time to get up and go to
work.</p>

<p>Every morning, without fail, Rusty
sang his dawn song right under Farmer
Green&rsquo;s window. His musical trill, sounding
very much like the brook that rippled
its way down the side of Blue Mountain,
always made Farmer Green feel glad that
another day had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that busy little chap is up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
often said, meaning Rusty Wren, of
course&mdash;&ldquo;if he&rsquo;s up there&rsquo;s no reason why
I should lie here and sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And since everybody else in the house
followed Farmer Green&rsquo;s custom of rising
early, it happened that so small a bird<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as Rusty Wren aroused the whole household
out of their beds.</p>

<p>To be sure, Johnnie Green&mdash;sitting up
and rubbing his eyes sleepily&mdash;sometimes
wished that Rusty would skip his dawn
song once in a while. And he told his
father at breakfast one day that since he
was not a bird, he saw no reason why he
should get up with the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Farmer Green.
&ldquo;But you know the old saying about
&lsquo;early to bed and early to rise,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Johnnie remembered that such habits
were supposed to make one &ldquo;healthy,
wealthy and wise.&rdquo; And since he hated to
take medicine, and was trying to save
enough money to buy him a gun, and disliked
to be kept in after school for not
knowing his lessons, he decided that perhaps
it was just as well, after all, to follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Rusty Wren&rsquo;s example.</p>

<p>Now, Farmer Green spoke so often and
so pleasantly of Rusty Wren, saying that
nobody could want a better little alarm
clock than he, that Rusty began to take a
great deal of pride in his morning task of
awakening the household. It could hardly
be called a task, however, because Rusty
thoroughly enjoyed singing, though when
he sang&mdash;as when he did anything else&mdash;he
put every ounce of his strength into
the effort. With his head lifted as high
as his short neck would permit, and his
tail (which usually stuck pertly upwards)
drooping downward, as if he had for the
moment forgotten it, he poured forth his
music with such fervor that his small body
actually trembled.</p>

<p>You see, Rusty Wren never did things
by halves. When he did anything he was
never satisfied with less than his best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>And that was another reason why Farmer
Green liked him.</p>

<h2>RUSTY IS JEALOUS</h2>


<p>Before Rusty Wren came to live in Farmer
Green&rsquo;s dooryard the family had
been known to oversleep now and then.
Working hard all day long as everybody
did (except Johnnie Green, who played
hard enough&mdash;goodness knows!), they
slept very soundly at night. And two or
three times every summer they were sure
to rise late, just by accident.</p>

<p>Though such a mishap always annoyed
Farmer Green, it never troubled either
the hired man or Johnnie in the least. On
the contrary, they seemed to enjoy those
occasions. But with Rusty Wren to rouse
them at dawn all that was changed. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Farmer Green remarked one day that one
thing was certain; they would lose no
time that summer by staying in bed too
long.</p>

<p>That very afternoon he had to go to
the village. And when he came home he
brought several surprises with him.</p>

<p>Those surprises pleased Johnnie and
his mother so much that when he went
to bed that night Farmer Green felt even
happier than was usual with him. He
went to bed somewhat early because he
said he had more work than ever to do the
next day, on account of his having gone
to the village.</p>

<p>But happy as he was that night, the following
morning Farmer Green was quite
out of sorts. For the whole family overslept.
Not a soul awaked until the sun
had been up at least an hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Farmer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Green said at the breakfast table&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand why I failed to hear that
wren this morning. I must have been
unusually sleepy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hired man helped himself to some
more griddle-cakes and remarked that it
was a pity. But somehow he did not <i>look</i>
sorry, in spite of what he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to bed early to-night,&rdquo; Farmer
Green continued, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;ll be sure to
wake up before sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, strange to say, the next morning
the very same accident happened again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s come over me,&rdquo; said
Farmer Green. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear that wren
singing right under my window any more.
I thought that maybe the cat had caught
him. But there he is this very moment,
on that limb!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody said it certainly was odd, for
the wren always sang as soon as it began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to grow light.</p>

<p>Well, that night Farmer Green went to
bed before dark, declaring that he must be
up bright and early in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that new clock I brought home
day before yesterday was an alarm clock,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry
about waking up on time.... Anyhow,
I ought to hear the wren again to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Farmer Green hoped in vain.
Though the cat had not caught Rusty, and
he had not moved away, either, he no longer
sang beneath Farmer Green&rsquo;s window
at dawn.</p>

<p>For three mornings he had gone to the
orchard to trill his dawn song; and though
they did not know the reason, that was
why the Green family rose late for three
mornings running.</p>

<p>Once Rusty Wren had been proud to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
called Farmer Green&rsquo;s alarm clock. But
now something had happened that made
him resolve to stop waking the household.</p>

<p>It was all on account of one of those
surprises that Farmer Green had brought
home from the village. For without intending
to do any such thing, Farmer
Green had surprised Rusty Wren as well
as Johnnie and his mother.</p>

<p>Now, a surprise may be one of two kinds&mdash;pleasant
or unpleasant. And, strangely
enough, the very thing that delighted the
Green family sent Rusty Wren into a
spasm of jealous rage.</p>

<p>Of course, it was very silly of him to
lose his temper. But he was too upset to
stop to think of that.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h2>THE NEW BIRD</h2>


<p>Farmer Green had not been home long,
after his trip to the village, when Rusty
Wren heard a sound that for once made
him keep quite still for at least five seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo; The cry came from
inside the farmhouse. And since the windows
were wide open, Rusty could easily
hear it from the tree near-by, where he
lived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a new bird in there!&rdquo; Rusty
Wren exclaimed to himself as soon as the
sound reached his ears. He listened intently.
But the call was not repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farmer Green is not satisfied with my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
singing!&rdquo; Rusty cried. And thereupon he
flew into such a rage that when his wife
came home, a few minutes later, she was
actually frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in the world is the matter?&rdquo; she
asked her husband anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; cried Rusty Wren. &ldquo;Here
I&rsquo;ve sung my best for Farmer Green all
summer, and waked him at dawn every
morning without fail! And what do you
suppose he&rsquo;s done? He has brought home
a strange bird from the village, because
he doesn&rsquo;t care for my singing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rusty Wren told her husband that
he must be mistaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe a bird flew inside the farmhouse
by accident,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What kind
of bird is it?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>said</i> &lsquo;Cuckoo!&rsquo;&rdquo; Rusty explained.
&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s a cuckoo, it&rsquo;s different from
any other I&rsquo;ve ever heard. You know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
yourself that Black Bill Cuckoo who lives
in the bushes beyond the orchard says
&lsquo;<i>Cow, cow!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry, if I were you,&rdquo; Mrs.
Rusty advised her husband. &ldquo;No doubt
this strange bird has already made his
escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then after sunset. And soon
Rusty Wren&rsquo;s family were all fast asleep,
without having heard any more bird notes
from the farmhouse.</p>

<p>The next morning Rusty awoke just as
the first streaks of gray showed in the
east. He was about to begin his dawn
song when through the kitchen window
came that &ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo; again.</p>

<p>Rusty knew then that the strange bird
was still there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; he asked his wife.</p>

<p>She nodded her head silently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s telling Farmer Green that it&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
time to get up!&rdquo; Rusty exclaimed indignantly.
&ldquo;And since Farmer Green has
seen fit to get somebody else to wake him,
I certainly shall not trouble myself on his
account any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Rusty Wren flew away to the orchard
to sing his dawn song. Jolly Robin,
who lived there, in an old apple tree, was
surprised to hear Rusty Wren singing in
that neighborhood so early. And he was
still more astonished at Rusty&rsquo;s melody.</p>

<p>His voice was so much shriller than
usual that Jolly Robin knew instantly
that something had displeased him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to upset you?&rdquo;
Jolly Robin inquired, after Rusty had finished
singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect to come here and give my
dawn song every morning,&rdquo; Rusty remarked.
&ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s anybody living
in the orchard that objects, he had better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
move away at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course Jolly Robin didn&rsquo;t want to
do that. And he said as much, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hope you&rsquo;ll sing a little more
happily,&rdquo; he told Rusty, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t
like to hear people complaining&mdash;and
neither does my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is easy to understand why Farmer
Green and his family overslept, when one
knows that Rusty Wren no longer sang
his dawn song beneath Farmer Green&rsquo;s
window. And when Rusty saw that the
whole household never stirred until long
after sunrise, he was so pleased that he
couldn&rsquo;t help making a few remarks about
the new bird in the farmhouse, which had
annoyed him so by singing &ldquo;Cuckoo!
cuckoo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This stranger is a very poor songster!&rdquo;
Rusty said to his wife. &ldquo;All he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
can sing is &lsquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rsquo; in that silly
way of his. He has no trills and runs and
ripples at all! And he can&rsquo;t even repeat
his song ten times a minute, as I give
mine. He has to wait at least half an hour
before he cries &lsquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rsquo; again.
And no one but a simpleton would ever
attempt to awaken a hard-working farmer
by such half-hearted singing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rusty quite agreed with her husband.</p>

<p><!--changed single quote to double quote-->&ldquo;Farmer Green will be sorry he
brought home such a worthless bird,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<h2>MR. CROW TO THE RESCUE</h2>


<p>As time went on, and the Green family
overslept each morning, Rusty began to
grow very weary of the monotonous
&ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo; which came every half
hour, all day long, through the kitchen
window of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what sort of bird that
is!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d only
come out here in the yard I&rsquo;d ask him his
name&mdash;and tell him what I think of him,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the stranger never stirred out of
the kitchen. And at length Rusty decided
to make inquiries about him. Seeing
Jimmy Rabbit passing through the orchard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
on his way home from the cabbage-patch,
Rusty called to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you happen to see old Mr. Crow,
I wish you would ask him if he won&rsquo;t
please come right over to the orchard,&rdquo;
Rusty Wren said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
I want to find out. And Mr. Crow knows
so much that perhaps he can help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit declared that he would
be delighted to deliver the message. And
he must have gone out of his way to find
Mr. Crow, for the old gentleman arrived
at the orchard in less than sixteen minutes.</p>

<p>Rusty was waiting for him. And, having
explained about the strange bird as
well as he could, he asked Mr. Crow what
he thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear his song,&rdquo; said old
Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right over to my tree near the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
house!&rdquo; Rusty urged him.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Farmer Green?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! He&rsquo;s working in the hayfield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Johnnie Green?&rdquo; Mr. Crow
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! He&rsquo;s in the hayfield, too, riding
on the hayrake,&rdquo; Rusty Wren explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you, then,&rdquo; Mr. Crow
croaked.</p>

<p>So they flew to the dooryard. And they
hadn&rsquo;t waited there long when the strange
bird sang his &ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Rusty. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his silly
song!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to his surprise Mr. Crow haw-hawed
right out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the joke?&rdquo; Rusty Wren
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bird&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said old Mr. Crow&mdash;&ldquo;or, at least, it&rsquo;s not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<i>real</i> bird. He&rsquo;s made of wood. And he lives inside a cuckoo clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Rusty cried. &ldquo;An alarm clock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But old Mr. Crow shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an everyday clock. And, instead of
striking, it lets this little wooden bird come out and sing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty Wren said that he wouldn&rsquo;t care for a clock like that and that he
didn&rsquo;t see why Farmer Green had brought it home, anyhow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cuckoo clocks amuse the women and children,&rdquo; Mr. Crow remarked wisely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you think Farmer Green was not dissatisfied with my singing? You
think he would like me to wake him every morning, just as I used to?&rdquo;
Rusty waited eagerly for Mr. Crow&rsquo;s opinion.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow pondered for a while before answering. He reflected that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
since it was long past corn-planting time, it really made no
difference to him whether Farmer Green overslept or not. If the corn had
just been put in the ground, he would have liked to have Farmer Green
stay in bed all day long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that the whole family enjoys your songs,&rdquo; Mr. Crow told
Rusty at last. &ldquo;And for the present you may as well sing your dawn song
right here in your own tree, beneath Farmer Green&rsquo;s window. But if
you&rsquo;re living here next spring, I wish you would consult me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty Wren agreed to that, thanking Mr. Crow for his kindness, too. And,
afterward, instead of being angry, he laughed whenever he heard that
silly &ldquo;Cuckoo! cuckoo!&rdquo; Since he knew it was
only a wooden bird, Rusty Wren was jealous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
no longer.</p>

<p>The next morning he awakened Farmer
Green at the break o&rsquo; day. And the hired
man was so sleepy that he fell downstairs
and couldn&rsquo;t work for a whole week.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h2>A NEAT HOUSEKEEPER</h2>


<p>Rusty Wren&rsquo;s wife was a very neat
housekeeper. Every day she carefully
cleaned her house, chirping while she
worked. Sometimes her voice was sweet
and pleasant. But at other times&mdash;though
it was still sweet&mdash;it was not pleasant at
all. And whenever Rusty heard that second
kind of chirp he was always careful
to find some errand that took him away
from home.</p>

<p>You see, Rusty Wren was not so orderly
as his wife. Often he scattered things
about the house in a very careless fashion.
For instance, if he happened to notice
a bit of moss&mdash;or a burr&mdash;clinging to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
his coat, just as likely as not he would
brush it off and let it fall upon the floor.
And when Mrs. Rusty found anything
like that in her cottage, she always knew
how it came there.</p>

<p>Rusty sometimes remarked that it was
a good thing he didn&rsquo;t smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like it if I dropped
bits of tobacco, or ashes, and maybe burnt
matches for you to pick up?&rdquo; he asked his
wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t come inside my house
if you used tobacco,&rdquo; she always replied.
And she would get quite excited at the
mere thought of such an untidy habit.</p>

<p>And then Rusty would smile&mdash;but he
always took good care not to let his wife
see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; he would say, if she
became too stirred up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never
smoked yet&mdash;and I never expect to.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>One can see that Rusty Wren was somewhat
of a tease. And as it usually happens
with people who amuse themselves
at the expense of others, there came a
time when Rusty&rsquo;s teasing landed him in
trouble.</p>

<p>One day after he had come home from
an excursion to the pasture (he seldom
strayed so far from home as that!), Mrs.
Rusty began sniffing the air. Her nose
would have wrinkled&mdash;only it couldn&rsquo;t,
because it was so hard. She looked at her
husband suspiciously. And it seemed to
her that he had a guilty manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve
been smoking.&rdquo; And she started to scold
so angrily that Rusty Wren knew she
must be in a temper.</p>

<p>Seeing signs of trouble, Rusty began to
fidget. And he moved about so uneasily
that his wife was all the surer of his guilt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
She stopped right in the middle of her
scolding to say, &ldquo;I smell smoke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you do,&rdquo; Rusty admitted.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s certainly not tobacco smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve
been smoking corn-silk, or hayseed&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s almost as bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Rusty said that it must be the
smoke of a pine stump that she noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farmer Green is burning some old
stumps in the pasture,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;And I flew through a cloud of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then he happened to notice a bit
of something or other clinging to one of
his tail feathers. And though his wife
was looking straight at him, he flicked the
tiny scrap upon the floor, without thinking
what he was doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again!&rdquo; Mrs. Rusty
Wren cried. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve just finished
cleaning the house and you&rsquo;re littering it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
all up! You don&rsquo;t care how much work
you make for me.&rdquo; And she pounced
upon the brownish bit, intending to pick
it up and throw it out of the house.</p>

<p>Rusty had already decided that he had
better go away from home for a little
while, until things were pleasanter, when
his wife suddenly faced about and fixed
him with her glittering eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; she cried, holding up the scrap
in her bill for him to see. &ldquo;Tobacco!&rdquo; she
screamed. &ldquo;And what, pray, have you to
say to me now?&rdquo;</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h2>RUSTY IN TROUBLE</h2>


<p>Rusty Wren edged toward the door&mdash;that
little opening in the syrup can, only
slightly bigger than a twenty-five-cent
piece. He wished he was already safely
through it, for he did not like the look in
his wife&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going now,&rdquo; he said faintly&mdash;though
he was generally as bold as
brass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; Mrs. Rusty ordered.
&ldquo;Where did this tobacco come from?&rdquo;
She spoke somewhat thickly, for she still
held the bit of brown leaf in her bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I
never knew it was sticking to my tail until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I saw it and brushed it off&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On my clean floor!&rdquo; his wife interrupted.
&ldquo;Goodness knows it&rsquo;s bad enough
to have you forever doing things like that
without your bringing <i>tobacco</i> into my
clean house&mdash;and without smelling of
smoke, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For almost the first time in his life
Rusty Wren was really worried. Somehow,
he had managed to get into something
a good deal like a scrape. It seemed
to him that the house was terribly hot and
stuffy; and always before he had thought
it quite comfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out for a breath of fresh
air,&rdquo; he protested feebly. And before
Mrs. Rusty could stop him he dodged past
her and slipped through the tiny doorway,
leaving her to scold to her heart&rsquo;s
content.</p>

<p>All this happened in the middle of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
morning. And the cuckoo clock in Farmer
Green&rsquo;s kitchen had sung the hour
six times before Rusty Wren returned.</p>

<p>Never before had he stayed away from
his snug house so long. And, naturally,
that made him have a guilty feeling, as
if he had really done something to be
ashamed of. As for smoking, he had (as
he said) never smoked in his life. It was
true that Farmer Green was burning
stumps in the pasture that morning, and
that the odor of the smoke had clung to
Rusty&rsquo;s feathers.</p>

<p>But the bit of tobacco that had clung
to his tail was a mystery that he couldn&rsquo;t
explain. It was a most unfortunate accident.
But Rusty hoped that by that
time&mdash;it was then the middle of the afternoon&mdash;he
hoped that his wife had recovered
from her displeasure. Usually, when
they had any little difference of opinion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
she felt better if he gave her plenty of
time in which to scold. But now Rusty
was not quite sure of his welcome. He
had never seen Mrs. Rusty so upset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you there, my love?&rdquo; he asked
softly, as he alighted on the roof of his
house. He did not care to go inside until
he was quite sure that his wife was in better
spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smoker has come home again,&rdquo; a
peevish voice called out. And instead of
bursting into the merry song which Rusty
had been all ready to carol, he flew off
across the yard and began hunting for
something to eat.</p>

<p>Since he couldn&rsquo;t very well go home, he
thought that he might as well enjoy a good

<h2>ALL&rsquo;S WELL AGAIN</h2>


<p>After Rusty Wren had revived his
drooping spirits by eating heartily of
three dozen insects of different kinds and
sizes, he felt so cheerful that he couldn&rsquo;t
help trilling a few songs. It was almost
evening; and he was glad not to let the
sun go down without thanking him in that
way for shining so brightly all day.</p>

<p>Though it was so late, Farmer Green
still toiled in the fields; but Rusty could
hear Johnnie and old dog Spot driving
the cows down the lane towards the barn.</p>

<p>Now, above the wide door of the carriage
house a window was open&mdash;a window
through which Rusty had flown early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in the morning. Unlike old Mr. Crow,
Rusty Wren was not in the least afraid
to enter any of the farm buildings. Perhaps
if Rusty had been in the habit of
taking Farmer Green&rsquo;s corn he would
have thought twice before he ventured inside
the cow barn or the carriage house.
But since he never damaged the crops,
and always helped them by destroying a
great number of insects that ate all sorts
of growing things, Rusty had nothing
whatever to fear from anybody in the
farmhouse&mdash;except the cat, of course.</p>

<p>There was really no reason for Rusty&rsquo;s
flying through the open window, beyond
the fact that he liked to prowl around
the great, dusty room under the eaves, to
see what he could find. Once he was inside,
he noticed something that had not
caught his eye on his former visit. Hanging
from a rafter, where the slanting rays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the setting sun fell squarely upon it,
was a big bunch of brown tobacco leaves.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren gave a chirp of pleasure
at the sight. That was where he must
have picked up the bit of tobacco that
had clung to his tail feathers and upset
his wife&rsquo;s good nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go right home and get her and
bring her here so she can see this tobacco
herself!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll
know where that shred came from which
fell on the floor.&rdquo; He did not say &ldquo;which
I brushed onto the floor,&rdquo; for he never
could remember long that he ever did such
careless things.</p>

<p>Well, Rusty Wren went out of the window
a good deal faster than he had flown
in. And, in less time than it takes to tell
it, he was perched on top of his house
again and calling to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know now where the tobacco came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from!&rdquo; he sang out. &ldquo;Just come outside
and I&rsquo;ll show you. It&rsquo;s upstairs in the
carriage house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his delight, Mrs. Rusty answered in
the sweetest tone imaginable. But she
said she didn&rsquo;t want to come out just then.
And she didn&rsquo;t seem a bit interested in
tobacco any more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come right into the house!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something here that I
want to show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty Wren whisked through the hole
in the maple syrup can. Home had never
looked quite so good to him before, for he
had not been there since the middle of
the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>His wife was sitting on their nest. And
there was nothing new in the house, so far
as he could see.</p>

<p>She moved aside then. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
said.</p>

<p>And, peering into the nest, Rusty saw
a speckled egg there. It was really a
small egg. But to Rusty Wren&rsquo;s eyes it
seemed decidedly big.</p>

<p>He was so surprised that he couldn&rsquo;t
speak for as much as two seconds. And
then he began to sing&mdash;he was so happy.</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Rusty kept very still, she
seemed much pleased. And, strange to
say, she never mentioned <i>smoking</i> to her
husband again.</p>

<p>She had something more important to
think about.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>

<h2>BAD NEWS</h2>


<p>When Johnnie Green fastened the tin can
to the tree in the dooryard he couldn&rsquo;t
have picked out a better spot for it. Of
course, he hoped that a pair of wrens
would build their nest inside the syrup
can. But what he never dreamed was that
the cherry tree was exactly the sort of
tree that wrens liked.</p>

<p>It was not that Rusty and his wife cared
for cherries. But as soon as Mrs. Wren
had said how much she liked her new
house, she remarked that the old cherry
tree was a fine place to hunt for bugs and
insects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Rusty agreed. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
an ant hill near the foot of the tree. It
will be very convenient on stormy days,
for we shall not have to go far for our
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not being fond of cherries, they did not
look forward to the time when the bright
red fruit should hang gaily upon the
branches above their home. But there
were others&mdash;besides Johnnie Green&mdash;who
eagerly awaited that time and noticed
that the old tree was loaded with
blossoms, which meant that later there
would be plenty of cherries.</p>

<p>Jolly Robin was one of those who had a
taste for cherries, no matter whether they
grew wild in the woods or within easy
reach in Farmer Green&rsquo;s yard. And as
soon as cherry time arrived Jolly was on
hand every day to enjoy the treat.</p>

<p>He was so cheerful and good-natured
that Rusty Wren and his wife did not object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to Jolly&rsquo;s visits&mdash;so long as he did
not venture too near their house. They
always scolded loudly when an outsider
came too close to their home, for they had
a big family of children, and they couldn&rsquo;t
help feeling that the youngsters were
safer with no prying busybodies to meddle
with them.</p>

<p>Of course, Jolly Robin never once
thought of harming any of Rusty&rsquo;s family.
And as soon as he saw that Rusty&mdash;and
especially his wife&mdash;wanted him to
keep away from their side of the tree, he
took care to respect their wishes.</p>

<p>Then all was peaceful. And the three
had many pleasant chats together.</p>

<p>At last, however, Jolly Robin made a remark
one day that threw both Rusty and
his wife into a flutter of alarm. Jolly
Robin had not meant to frighten them.
But the news was out before he realized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that it was far from welcome to his two
little listeners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jasper Jay has heard about these cherries,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;And he says he&rsquo;s
coming over here as soon as he can find
time, for he is specially fond of all
kinds of cherries, no matter whether
they&rsquo;re red cherries or black cherries or
choke cherries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty Wren glanced quickly at his
wife.</p>

<p>He could easily see that Jolly Robin&rsquo;s
speech had upset her. And, to tell the
truth, he did not himself relish the prospect
of a visit from anybody as boisterous
and quarrelsome as that famous bully,
Jasper Jay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you prevent his coming?&rdquo;
Rusty asked Jolly Robin.</p>

<p>But Jolly Robin shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Jasper Jay makes up his mind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I know of no way to make him change
it,&rdquo; he said.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<h2>THE NOISE ON THE ROOF</h2>


<p>As soon as she heard that Jasper Jay intended
to visit her cherry tree, to enjoy
the ripe fruit, Rusty Wren&rsquo;s wife began
to worry. And she made herself so unhappy
that Rusty couldn&rsquo;t help wishing
that Jolly Robin had kept his news to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed!&rdquo; he said to her,
after Jolly had gone. &ldquo;Jasper Jay can&rsquo;t
harm the children, for they&rsquo;ll be safe in
the nest. And luckily our doorway is too
small for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Rusty wouldn&rsquo;t be calmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great, cruel bully,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;And if he spends much time here I&rsquo;m<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
afraid the children will starve, for neither
you nor I will be able to go out and find
food for them, because Jasper would be
sure to pounce on us; and what chance
would we have against him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go together,&rdquo; said Rusty Wren,
looking very brave.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Wren said she wouldn&rsquo;t think
of leaving her six small children all alone
in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything will be all right,&rdquo; Rusty
assured her. &ldquo;You know Jasper isn&rsquo;t
coming unless he can <i>find the time</i>. Jolly
Robin said so. And maybe he won&rsquo;t be
able to get here at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had gone inside their house to talk
over the matter in private. And Rusty
had hardly finished speaking when a loud
bang, followed by a clatter, sounded on
the tin roof above their heads.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that they both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Rusty&rsquo;s wife.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Rusty couldn&rsquo;t tell her. During all
the weeks they had lived there he had
heard nothing like that.</p>

<p>While they listened the noise was repeated.
And Mrs. Rusty declared that
the sky must be falling, for she had never
heard such a dreadful sound in all her
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go right out and see what it is,&rdquo;
Rusty Wren said.</p>

<p>But his wife caught hold of his coat-tails
and begged him to stay with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You must not
stir out of the house. I&rsquo;d be terribly worried
if you left me alone here with these
six small children. And you might get
hurt, besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the racket on the roof continued,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
with only a short pause between
each outburst. The six Wren children
began to cry&mdash;for they were hungry as
well as frightened. And all the time Mrs.
Rusty clung to her husband&rsquo;s coat-tails
and besought him not to leave her.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he had no such intention.
Though he was very brave for
his size, he was thoroughly alarmed. And
for the time being he was quite content
to stay inside his snug house and hope
that the trouble would soon come to an
end.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the whole, the Wren family spent a
very unpleasant quarter of an hour. The
<i>bang, clatter, bang</i> on their roof still continued
until the din became almost unbearable.
And Rusty Wren grew so desperate
that he had almost made up his
mind to break away from his wife, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
if he had to leave his coat-tails behind him,
and dash out of doors to see what was
the matter.</p>

<p>Then all at once a different sound fell
upon their ears. And as soon as they
heard it they knew at once that the sky
was not falling, anyhow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Jay! jay!</i>&rdquo; Jasper Jay&rsquo;s harsh voice
was unmistakable. He had been playing
one of his sly tricks on the Wren family;
and they had never guessed that it was he!</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<h2>THE UNWELCOME VISITOR</h2>


<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jasper Jay!&rdquo; Rusty Wren cried, as
soon as he and his wife heard the hoarse
cry outside their house. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s playing
one of his tricks on us. And I&rsquo;m going
out and tell him exactly what I think of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to tell him what I think
of him, too!&rdquo; Mrs. Rusty said, as she let
go of her husband&rsquo;s coat-tails.</p>

<p>Then Rusty hurried through the little
doorway. And there was Jasper, sitting
on a limb above the house, with a cherry
in his bill, which he let fall with a sly
smile.</p>

<p>The cherry struck the roof of Rusty&rsquo;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
house with a loud <i>bang</i>! And then came
the same <i>clatter</i>, to which the Wren family
had been listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Stop that!&rdquo; Rusty cried.</p>

<p>Jasper Jay shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; said Rusty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away yourself!&rdquo; retorted Jasper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my home,&rdquo; Rusty Wren told
him hotly. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve no right to come
here and frighten my wife and children
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall I frighten them, then?&rdquo;
Jasper Jay asked him. &ldquo;Perhaps you
like this way better!&rdquo; he shouted. And
with that he flew straight at Rusty Wren.
He was so big and he looked so cruel that
Rusty turned tail and dashed back into his
house again. And he was glad that his
doorway was not much bigger than a
twenty-five-cent piece, because he knew
that Jasper Jay could never squeeze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
through so small an opening.</p>

<p>Jasper alighted on top of the house and
jumped up and down on the roof, striking
it with his bill and screaming angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&rdquo; Rusty said to his
wife. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do any harm. And after
a while he&rsquo;ll grow tired of staying here
and he&rsquo;ll go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, Rusty was half right, at least.
For Jasper Jay went away at last; but he
didn&rsquo;t wait until he had grown weary of
his rowdyish sport.</p>

<p>Now, Johnnie Green happened to hear
Jasper&rsquo;s harsh cries. And, looking out of
the window, he saw Jasper&rsquo;s strange performance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That blue jay is teasing my little
wrens!&rdquo; Johnnie Green cried indignantly.
And, catching up a potato from the
kitchen table, he hurried to the door and
hurled it as hard as he could at the blue-coated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
trouble-maker.</p>

<p>The potato missed Jasper Jay by less
than an inch, bringing up <i>kerplunk!</i>
against the trunk of the old cherry tree,
and breaking into several pieces.</p>

<p>And then it was Jasper Jay&rsquo;s turn to be
alarmed. He jumped off the roof of
Rusty Wren&rsquo;s house as if he had been shot
and dashed off as fast as his handsome
wings could carry him. He knew of no
way to tease Johnnie Green; so there was
really no sense in his staying in Farmer
Green&rsquo;s yard any longer.</p>

<p>Johnnie jeered at Jasper as the frightened
bully hurried away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not come skulking around
here again!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>Although the cherries hung red and
juicy upon the old tree for at least a week
longer, just begging to be picked&mdash;as one
might say&mdash;Jasper Jay did not come back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to enjoy them. He told Jolly Robin that
he was entirely too busy to waste his time
in an old cherry tree.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<h2>BOY WANTED!</h2>


<p>It seemed to take Rusty Wren&rsquo;s wife a
long time to recover from the fright that
Jasper Jay had given her. He had amused
himself by dropping cherries upon the
roof of her house. But the trick had not
amused the Wren family in the least.</p>

<p>Even after Johnnie Green had driven
the blue-coated rascal away from the
dooryard Mrs. Rusty Wren was all aflutter.
She jumped at the slightest noise.
And she was so nervous that Rusty soon
saw that it was a great effort for her to
go abroad for food for their hungry family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must stay right here at home and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
rest,&rdquo; he urged her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find enough for
the children to eat&mdash;and for you too,&rdquo; he<!--page 63: changed period to comma-->
said manfully.</p>

<p>And really there was nothing else that
his wife could do; for her nerves were in
a frightful state.</p>

<p>So Rusty Wren took up his task cheerfully.
He found it no easy one, either.
Feeding six growing youngsters had kept
both their parents working every minute
all day long, because the children were always
clamoring for more food. And now
they seemed half starved, for they had
had nothing to eat all the time that Jasper
Jay had kept Rusty and his wife hiding
in their house.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren, however, was not one to
complain, no matter what happened. And
every day from dawn till dark he hurried
out of the house to find some toothsome
insect, and bring it home to drop it into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
somebody&rsquo;s yawning mouth.</p>

<p>Indeed, he was so busy feeding his family
that he scarcely had a chance to eat
anything himself. So he grew quite thin.
And though he still sang as merrily as
ever, his wife noticed the change that had
come over him.</p>

<p>Naturally, that made her worry. And
since worrying was bad for her nerves,
she began to grow worse instead of better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to become
of us,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;As the children
grow bigger they need more to eat. And
I can see plainly that you&rsquo;re never going
to be able to provide enough for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;ll soon be old enough to leave
home and catch their own insects,&rdquo; Rusty
told her hopefully. &ldquo;And until that time
comes I&rsquo;ll manage somehow, even if I have
to work after dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that plan did not suit his wife at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care to stay alone in the
house at night with six small children,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;That will never do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; Rusty cried suddenly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get somebody to help me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, his wife didn&rsquo;t think much of that
plan, either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of any strange
bird coming into my house,&rdquo; she objected.
&ldquo;And you know yourself that you&rsquo;ve always
felt the same way about strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he replied&mdash;&ldquo;but this is
different. I&rsquo;ll find a brisk young fellow
somewhere. And after a day or two you
won&rsquo;t mind his being here. He&rsquo;ll seem
just like one of the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took a good deal of urging before
Mrs. Rusty consented. But at last she
said she was willing to give the plan a
trial, though she felt sure it was bound to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
cause trouble, somehow.</p>

<p>So that is how Rusty Wren came to
hang a sign outside his door, which said:</p>

<p class="center">BOY WANTED</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<h2>TOO MANY CALLERS</h2>


<p>The news of Rusty Wren&rsquo;s sign, &ldquo;Boy
Wanted,&rdquo; spread like wildfire through
the whole of Pleasant Valley. Rusty had
put the sign out at daybreak. And before
sunset as many as fifty of the field
and forest people had come shyly to Farmer
Green&rsquo;s dooryard.</p>

<p>Some of them came to apply for the position,
and some of them merely wanted
to see the sign&mdash;for it was a most unusual
sight in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>There were others, too, such as Fatty
Coon and Tommy Fox, who said that
while they didn&rsquo;t care to visit Farmer
Green&rsquo;s place in the daytime, they expected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to call there during the night and
take a look at Rusty Wren&rsquo;s home and the
odd sign upon it.</p>

<p>Yes! So quiet a person as Rusty Wren,
who never wandered far from home, had
become famous in a day.</p>

<p>Yet it proved to be a very bad day for
Rusty&rsquo;s family, because he had almost no
time at all in which to try to bring home
any food. No sooner had he talked with
one caller than another knocked at his
door. And so the steady stream of strangers
kept him busy as a little red wagon,
as Farmer Green would remark.</p>

<p>It was a discouraging business, to say
the least. Though Rusty had advertised
for a &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; persons of all ages appeared
and wanted to work for him. Some of
them were old enough to be his grandfather.
And, what was worse, they were
all so big that they couldn&rsquo;t squeeze<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
through Rusty&rsquo;s little round door. (The
hole in the syrup can, you will remember,
was only slightly larger than a quarter
of a dollar.)</p>

<p>Of course, there was no use of his hiring
a helper that could do only half the work.
What Rusty wanted was somebody that
could not only catch an insect, but bring
it right inside the house and drop it into
the mouth of one of his children.</p>

<p>At last when Rusty had almost given
up all hope of finding anyone of the required
size, a young English sparrow flew
up and said boldly that he was the very
person for the position. He claimed that
he could get in and out of Rusty&rsquo;s door
without any trouble. And he was just
about to prove his claim, too, when Rusty
Wren stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; he told the sparrow.
&ldquo;My wife is calling me. And I must see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
what she wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he disappeared inside his house, to
return shortly with a doleful look upon
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he said to
the young English sparrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the stranger impertinently.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to see that your wife
rules the house. And, since that&rsquo;s the case,
I&rsquo;m very glad I&rsquo;m not going to work for
you.&rdquo; He flew away then, with a jeering
laugh which made Rusty Wren feel quite
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Rusty had overheard the talk
outside her door. And she had no intention
of letting any rude, noisy English
sparrow&mdash;even if he was a young one&mdash;come
inside her house.</p>

<p>That was why she called to her husband.
And she made the matter so plain that
Rusty knew there was no use of trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
change her mind for her.</p>

<p>Things were growing worse and worse.
The children were all <i>cheeping</i> for food,
until Rusty Wren could hardly endure the
noise.</p>

<p>And he, too, felt painfully hungry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h2>MR. CHIPPY&rsquo;S SON</h2>


<p>Rusty Wren was hurrying out of his
house to find some supper for his family,
when he almost bumped into a young
chap who was gazing at the sign, &ldquo;Boy
Wanted,&rdquo; which still hung outside
Rusty&rsquo;s door.</p>

<p>He was a likely-looking lad, who wore
a bay cap on his head. And he had excellent
manners, too. He said &ldquo;Good-evening!&rdquo;
to Rusty very pleasantly and
touched his cap. No doubt he would have
taken it off had it not grown right on his
head. &ldquo;I see you want a boy,&rdquo; he observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do!&rdquo; said Rusty Wren.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call me &lsquo;Chippy, Junior,&rsquo;&rdquo; the
youngster told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Rusty exclaimed. &ldquo;Then
your father must be Mr. Chippy, who
lives in the wild grapevine on the stone
wall by the roadside.&rdquo;<!--page 73: added missing closing quote--></p>

<p>Chippy, Jr., nodded brightly. And
when he said, &ldquo;<i>Chip, chip, chip, chip,</i>&rdquo; <!--changed placement of comma and italics vs text version-->
Rusty knew that there could be no doubt
about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait just a moment!&rdquo; he told Chippy,
Jr. &ldquo;I want to speak to my wife about
you.&rdquo; And then he darted back into his
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Rusty,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the very person! Little Mr.
Chippy&rsquo;s son is outside and I&rsquo;m sure we
ought to be glad to have a modest young
man like him to help us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He comes from a good family,&rdquo; Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Rusty admitted. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know
that the Chippys are bigger than we are?
Not much bigger, to be sure. But Mr.
Chippy certainly couldn&rsquo;t get through our
doorway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite true, my love!&rdquo; Rusty Wren
agreed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s his son&mdash;not <i>he</i>&mdash;that
wants to work for us. And this young
lad is not full grown. I should say he
was hardly my size.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though his wife hesitated, she could
think of no further objection. So at last
she told Rusty that he might ask Chippy,
Jr., to come back early the next morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have a feeling that this is going
to lead to trouble,&rdquo; she said once more.
Rusty Wren said, &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; He was
overjoyed at the prospect of having a spry
young helper. And he hurried out to tell
Mr. Chippy&rsquo;s son that he might start to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
work at daybreak.</p>

<p>That polite young man touched his cap
again, promised that he would return
without fail, and then went <i>chip-chipping</i>
away toward home, for it was already his
bedtime.</p>

<p>For all he was still hungry, Rusty Wren
slept better that night than he had for a
long while. He felt as if a great load had
been lifted off his shoulders.</p>

<p>He slept so soundly, in fact, that he
never waked up all when Fatty Coon
and Tommy Fox came at midnight to view
his sign, &ldquo;Boy Wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made a good deal of noise, too,
grumbling not a little because there was
not the least sign of a sign anywhere they
looked.</p>

<p>As soon as he had engaged Chippy, Jr.,
to work for him, Rusty Wren had taken
down the sign, &ldquo;Boy Wanted.&rdquo; And so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
all further callers were bound to be disappointed.</p>

<h2>THE ACCIDENT</h2>


<p>Chippy, Jr., proved to be a great success.
Even Mrs. Rusty Wren had to admit, before
he had finished his first day&rsquo;s work,
that he was an agreeable person to have
about the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he isn&rsquo;t much of a singer,&rdquo;
she remarked to Rusty, &ldquo;but he seems to
have a quick eye for an insect, and he is
kind to the children. He is very neat, besides.
I have watched him sharply,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t caught him tracking
any dirt into the house&mdash;nor brushing
any off his clothes onto my clean floor,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty, too, declared himself well satisfied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
with his helper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a spry worker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
he can get through our door as easily as
I can. He went in and out of the house
two hundred and fifty-seven times to-day;
and not once did he get stuck in the doorway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For several days everything went so
smoothly in Rusty Wren&rsquo;s household that
his wife began to feel more like herself
again. Jasper Jay did not come near
their house to annoy them; and there was
plenty of food for all&mdash;thanks to the untiring
efforts of Chippy, Jr. Though she
tried her hardest, Mrs. Rusty couldn&rsquo;t
think of anything to worry about. And
her husband frequently remarked that it
was a lucky day for all of them when he
decided to hire a boy.</p>

<p>Both Rusty and his wife had quite forgotten
the strange feeling of that good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
little lady&rsquo;s that some sort of trouble was
coming to them on account of taking an
outsider into their house.</p>

<p>So the days passed happily for them.
And all the while their six children were
fast growing bigger. The proud parents
often remarked that they had never
before known youngsters to change so
rapidly.</p>

<p>So interested were Rusty and his wife
in their children that they failed to see
that Chippy, Jr., was growing likewise.
Indeed, he now overtopped Rusty by half
a head. But the Wrens&mdash;both husband
and wife&mdash;entirely overlooked that fact.</p>

<p>Neither did they happen to notice that
Chippy, Jr., was beginning to have a good
deal of trouble squeezing through the
door. For some reason&mdash;due, perhaps, to
the way the opening was made&mdash;for some
reason he could get into the house more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
easily than he could get out of it.</p>

<p>He said nothing about this new difficulty,
not wishing to disturb the happiness
of the Wren family, nor find himself
out of work, either.</p>

<p>Since he continued to grow from day
to day there could be but one outcome.
And at last when Rusty came home late
one afternoon with a plump insect in his
bill he found Chippy, Jr., blocking the
doorway. His head peered through the
round opening. And his face wore a worried
expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; said Rusty Wren. &ldquo;I
want to come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at that Chippy, Jr., began to struggle
to get out. But he couldn&rsquo;t move
either forward or back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be spry!&rdquo; Rusty said impatiently.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me waiting, boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chippy, Jr., looked actually frightened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck fast!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
move either way!&rdquo;</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII</h2>

<h2>HELP! HELP!</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; Rusty Wren called loudly
to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; she screamed. Since
she was inside the house, and Rusty was
outside, with Chippy, Jr., blocking the
doorway, of course she was alarmed&mdash;for
she couldn&rsquo;t see her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This boy&rsquo;s stuck fast in our door,&rdquo;
Rusty cried. &ldquo;And you must help me
move him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; she answered in a frightened
tone. &ldquo;But if we can&rsquo;t stir him, I
don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; And she began
to shriek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; Rusty shouted. &ldquo;Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
say when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready now,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One, two, three&mdash;all together!&rdquo; Rusty
Wren commanded. And he seized the
head of Chippy, Jr., and began pulling as
hard as he knew how.</p>

<p>Chippy, Jr., at once let out a frightened
cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what the trouble is, but I feel as if
I should break in two!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo; exclaimed Rusty Wren.
And then to his wife he said: &ldquo;Were
you pushing or pulling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pulling!&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I was tugging
on his coat-tails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! That was the trouble,&rdquo; Rusty
told poor Chippy, Jr., who looked quite
distressed. &ldquo;I was trying to pull you out;
and she was trying to pull you in. But
you mustn&rsquo;t mind a little mistake like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Chippy, Jr., meekly.
&ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t do it again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Rusty directed his wife, so
that she might understand clearly what
was required of her&mdash;&ldquo;now you must push
while I pull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All their efforts, however, failed to
move the unfortunate Chippy, Jr. He remained
wedged tightly in the doorway.
And at last Rusty declared that they
might as well stop trying to get him
through it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you must do now,&rdquo; he directed
his wife, &ldquo;is to pull on Chippy, Jr.&rsquo;s, coat-tails,
while I push against his head. And
in that way we may be able to clear our
doorway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That plan worked better. In a short
time Mr. Chippy&rsquo;s unlucky son suddenly
slipped backward, knocking Mrs. Rusty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Wren flat on her back. And Rusty himself
tumbled into the house and fell on
top of the heap.</p>

<p>As soon as they had picked themselves
up, Rusty Wren and his wife and Chippy,
Jr., looked at one another for a few moments
without saying a single word.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rusty was the first to break the
silence&mdash;if a house may be said to be silent
when there are six children in it, all clamoring
for something to eat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew we should have some sort of
trouble if we took a stranger into our
home,&rdquo; she wailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; Rusty
inquired in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter?&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this
great lout of a boy inside our house! And
we&rsquo;ll never be able to get rid of him. Instead
of his helping us to feed our children,
we shall have to feed him! And now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
we are worse off than we ever were before.&rdquo;</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII</h2>

<h2>THE PUZZLE</h2>


<p>Rusty Wren looked quite crestfallen as
he listened to his wife&rsquo;s wail. He wished
that he had heeded her warning, when
she declared that his hiring a boy would
certainly lead to trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Rusty
asked his helper, Chippy, Jr. &ldquo;When you
first came to work for us you could slip
through our doorway easily enough. But
now you&rsquo;re altogether too big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chippy, Jr., said that the entrance to
their house must have shrunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could it?&rdquo; Rusty demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It rained last night,&rdquo; the youngster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
reminded him.</p>

<p>But Rusty Wren said, &ldquo;Nonsense! The
doorway&rsquo;s made of tin&mdash;not wood. <i>You</i>
have grown&mdash;that&rsquo;s the whole trouble!
And you&rsquo;ve got us into a pretty fix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I begin to think that it was all planned
this way by his father,&rdquo; Mrs. Rusty told
her husband, &ldquo;so Mr. Chippy wouldn&rsquo;t
have to take care of his son. But I don&rsquo;t
intend to adopt a big, overgrown boy like
him&mdash;not when I have six small children
of my own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chippy, Jr., couldn&rsquo;t help feeling both
uncomfortable and unhappy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go home!&rdquo; he blubbered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost my bedtime. And my father
and my mother won&rsquo;t like it at all if I stay
here all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Rusty Wren, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know how you&rsquo;re going to leave our house
if you can&rsquo;t squeeze through the door. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll hurry over and tell your father about
this trouble, and he can break the news
gently to your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Rusty went off, flying directly to
the stone wall where the Chippy family
lived. And soon he was explaining to Mr.
Chippy how his son was inside their house
and couldn&rsquo;t leave.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Chippy was unusually mild
mannered. But he became greatly excited
as soon as he heard Rusty&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like being caught in a trap!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t help feeling
that you&rsquo;ve played a trick on my son&mdash;probably
to please Johnnie Green....
If you don&rsquo;t set my boy free to-morrow
morning at daybreak, I shall certainly
make trouble for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chippy&rsquo;s warning amazed Rusty
Wren. But he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at
the idea of anybody causing him any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>trouble</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so deep in trouble now,&rdquo; he told
Mr. Chippy, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing you can do
to make matters any worse for me. I&rsquo;ve
six growing children to bring up; and now
I have your son to take care of; and my
wife thinks everything is my fault, because
I wanted to hire a boy to help me
catch insects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t scare me by your threats.
I only wish you would come to my house
and take your son away with you&mdash;if you
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll tear your house
down!&rdquo; Mr. Chippy cried fiercely. And
he began screaming, &ldquo;<i>Chip, chip, chip,
chip</i>,&rdquo; in a very shrill voice which was
most annoying to hear.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren did not like to listen to
him. So he flew back home and went to
bed. He only wished that it were possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
for Mr. Chippy to break into his house
and rescue Chippy, Jr. But since the
house was made of tin, Rusty knew that
Mr. Chippy was helpless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never settle in a tin house again
so long as I live!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX</h2>

<h2>A FRIEND, INDEED</h2>


<p>The next morning Rusty Wren awakened
with a start. Somebody was pounding
at his door&mdash;and shouting his name,
as well. He jumped out of bed to see what
was the matter. And, looking outside, he
beheld Mr. Chippy, with sixteen of his
cousins, all very much excited&mdash;if one
might judge by their actions.</p>

<p>They were flying back and forth past
Rusty&rsquo;s doorway and <i>chipping</i> in shrill
and piercing tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for my son,&rdquo; Mr. Chippy informed
Rusty Wren. &ldquo;Send him out here
at once or it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad to get rid of him if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
could,&rdquo; Rusty answered. &ldquo;But, as I explained
to you last night, he has grown so
big that he can no longer pass through my
doorway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to argue with you?&rdquo; Mr.
Chippy replied. &ldquo;Just let me have
Chippy, Jr., or we&rsquo;ll come inside your
house and get him. We&rsquo;ll make trouble
for you, too. Perhaps you didn&rsquo;t know
that kidnapping a child is a very serious
act. I&rsquo;ve already asked Solomon Owl&rsquo;s
opinion about this matter; and he advises
me to take my child away from you by
force, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense in waiting any longer,&rdquo;
one of Mr. Chippy&rsquo;s cousins interrupted.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go right in and seize the
lad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the mob crowded round Rusty
Wren&rsquo;s door. And the pert gentleman
who had just spoken thrust his head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
through the opening.</p>

<p>That, however, was as far as he was
able to go. His shoulders were altogether
too broad for the small, round passage.
And though his relations attempted to
push him into the house, they soon saw
that they would never succeed in their undertaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try!&rdquo; another of Mr. Chippy&rsquo;s
cousins cried. But he had no better luck
than the first.</p>

<p>Then each of the fourteen remaining
cousins&mdash;and then Mr. Chippy himself&mdash;had
his turn at the door. But every one
of them found that he was about two sizes
too big to squeeze through it.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren, watching then from inside
his house, couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, although
it was really no joke.<!--page 94: added missing period--></p>

<p>Though he was usually very mild, Mr.
Chippy grew terribly angry the moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he heard Rusty&rsquo;s laughter. His sixteen
cousins began to scold, too. Again they
tried to crowd through Rusty Wren&rsquo;s
door. And they made such an uproar that
when Johnnie Green stepped out of the
farmhouse before breakfast he couldn&rsquo;t
help noticing them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; he cried. And
he hurried to his &ldquo;wren house,&rdquo; as he
called Rusty&rsquo;s home, and drove away the
noisy visitors.</p>

<p>Then he shinned up the old cherry tree,
to peep inside it. And as soon as he
reached the tin can which was Rusty&rsquo;s
home Johnnie Green thought he heard an
unusual cry within it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound like a wren!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;It sounds exactly like a
chipping sparrow!&rdquo; Then, as he looked,
he saw Chippy, Jr.&rsquo;s, head, with its bright
bay cap, peer through the mouth of the syrup can.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chippy inside my wren house!&rdquo; Johnnie Green shouted to his
father, who had come to a window to see what was going on. &ldquo;How can I
get him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment!&rdquo; said Farmer Green. And soon he came and handed Johnnie
a can-opener.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut out the end of the can!&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be able to
reach in and get the little beggar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally, Chippy, Jr., did not like to be called a &ldquo;beggar.&rdquo; But he
couldn&rsquo;t very well prevent Farmer Green from saying whatever he pleased.
So he kept still, while Johnnie Green quickly opened a great hole in
Rusty&rsquo;s house. Then Johnnie carefully lifted Chippy, Jr., out of his
prison and gave him a toss into the air.</p>

<p>That frightened young gentleman wasted no time. He stopped to touch his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
cap to nobody, but flew away to his home in the wild grapevine, on the
stone wall, as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>Though he had kept quiet, the whole Wren family had made a great uproar.
Glad as they were to get rid of their troublesome guest, they objected
to having the whole front of their house torn out.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mrs. Rusty began to get ready to move out at once. And everybody
knows that moving is no joke&mdash;especially if one has six children.</p>

<p>But Johnnie Green bent the tin into place again, so that it was almost
the same as new. In fact, the house was even better than ever, because
it was more airy.</p>

<p>And Rusty and his wife were so glad to see the last of Chippy, Jr., that
afterward they never objected in the least when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Johnnie Green called them &ldquo;my wrens.&rdquo;
They had discovered that he was a good
friend to have.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX</h2>

<h2>AN INVITATION</h2>


<p>Rusty Wren&rsquo;s cousin, Long Bill, lived in
the reeds on the bank of Black Creek.
Although everybody called him &ldquo;Long
Bill,&rdquo; like Rusty Wren he was actually
short and chubby. His bill, however, was
much longer than Rusty&rsquo;s. You see, he
belonged to one branch of the Marsh
Wren family; and they all had bills like
that.</p>

<p>Long Bill Wren always claimed that his
real name was William; but people generally
smiled when he made that statement.</p>

<p>It was not often that Rusty met this
cousin of his, for Rusty seldom ventured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
so far from home as Black Creek. And
being very fond of water, Long Bill did
not care to spend any of his valuable time
in Farmer Green&rsquo;s dooryard.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the duck pond not
far away&mdash;and the river, too. But the
only water really close to Rusty&rsquo;s home
was the watering-trough. And that was
entirely too small to please Long Bill
Wren. So no one ever saw him around
the farm buildings.</p>

<p>For a long time Rusty had neither seen
nor heard of his cousin, when one day
Jolly Robin knocked at his door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come in,&rdquo; said Jolly (of
course he couldn&rsquo;t have, anyhow&mdash;being
far too big to get through Rusty&rsquo;s door!).
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come in, for I merely want to
give you a message. Old Mr. Crow came
to the orchard to-day and he asked me to
deliver an invitation from your cousin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
who lives near Black Creek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Long Bill!&rdquo; Rusty Wren exclaimed.</p>

<p>Jolly Robin nodded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to
have a party,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And he
wants you to come to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will it take place?&rdquo; Rusty
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; said Jolly Robin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather short notice,&rdquo; Rusty Wren
observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crow has been keeping the message
for you for some time,&rdquo; Jolly Robin
explained. &ldquo;He said he thought it would
be more of a surprise if you didn&rsquo;t know
about the party too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be there, anyhow,&rdquo; Rusty&rsquo;s wife
interrupted behind her husband&rsquo;s back.
She had been listening with a good deal
of interest to Jolly&rsquo;s message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not invited,&rdquo; Jolly Robin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
told her. &ldquo;This is a men&rsquo;s party&mdash;so Mr.
Crow says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may tell old Mr. Crow that my
husband won&rsquo;t be able to be present,&rdquo;
Mrs. Rusty Wren snapped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going
to be very busy to-morrow, for he promised
to help me with my house-cleaning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty Wren looked worried. But he
said nothing more just then. He wanted
to go to his cousin&rsquo;s party. But he did
not like to argue with his wife, especially
in the presence of a neighbor.</p>

<p>Soon Jolly Robin said he must go back
to the orchard, because he had to take care
of his children while his wife went out to
make a call.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rusty did not urge him to stay.
And, since she seemed upset over something,
Rusty thought it just as well if
their visitor did not linger there too long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just going to the orchard myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to hunt for insects,&rdquo; said Rusty. &ldquo;So
I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rusty shot a quick look at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember! You&rsquo;re going to be busy
at home to-morrow!&rdquo; she warned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes!&rdquo; he said. And he seemed in
a bit of a hurry to get to the orchard&mdash;it
couldn&rsquo;t have been <i>to get away from
home</i>.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI</h2>

<h2>OFF TO BLACK CREEK</h2>


<p>As soon as they reached the orchard, Jolly
Robin exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s old Mr. Crow
now, over there on the fence! He&rsquo;s come
back to get your answer and take it to
Long Bill Wren. I&rsquo;ll have to tell him
you&rsquo;re sorry&mdash;but you&rsquo;re going to be too
busy to-morrow to go to the party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Rusty Wren&mdash;&ldquo;tell
him that <i>although</i> I expect to be
busy, I am going to my cousin&rsquo;s party just
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jolly Robin stopped and sat down on
a branch of an apple tree, he was so surprised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
&ldquo;My dear sir!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You
seem to have forgotten that your wife said
you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to accept Long Bill&rsquo;s
invitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Rusty Wren&mdash;&ldquo;my
wife sometimes makes mistakes.
And this is one of them. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss
my cousin&rsquo;s party for anything. And I
don&rsquo;t intend to, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Jolly Robin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
to see that you don&rsquo;t let your wife manage
your affairs, though I <i>have</i> heard differently
about you, for some people say
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped abruptly and
looked carefully around. Whatever it
may have been that he was about to say,
for some reason he did not care to have
his wife hear it. And he happened to
think that perhaps Mrs. Robin might be
near-by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what people say,&rdquo; Rusty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Wren told him. &ldquo;When my cousin gives
a party it would be a shame if I couldn&rsquo;t
go to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said Jolly
Robin. &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll go and give old
Mr. Crow your answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; Rusty Wren exclaimed.
&ldquo;What time will my cousin&rsquo;s
party begin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; Jolly Robin replied.
&ldquo;And it will last till sundown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Rusty Wren helped
his wife so spryly that long before midday
the house-cleaning was finished. Although
she tried her best, Mrs. Rusty
could think of no more tasks for her husband
to do&mdash;except to feed the children.
That was a duty that would not be finished
until they were old enough to leave
home and shift for themselves.</p>

<p>On this day Rusty Wren dropped so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
many dainties into their gaping mouths
that his wife had to tell him that she
didn&rsquo;t dare let the youngsters have anything
more to eat until the next day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you ought to stay in the
house and have a good rest until just before
sunset,&rdquo; she told Rusty. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
worked very hard ever since dawn. And
I know you&rsquo;re tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Rusty declared that he much preferred
to be out of doors enjoying the fine
weather.</p>

<p>His wife looked at him sharply when he
said that. All day long neither of them
had mentioned the party which Rusty&rsquo;s
cousin, Long Bill Wren, was going to give
at five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Rusty, as he moved
about uncomfortably under his wife&rsquo;s
gaze, &ldquo;I think that since I&rsquo;ve a little time
to spare I&rsquo;d better go and see Mr. Frog,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the tailor. You know you&rsquo;ve been telling
me that my Sunday coat is beginning to
look shiny&mdash;and I suppose I really ought
to have a new one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Rusty said that it was true&mdash;he
did need a new coat. And she assured
her husband that she would be delighted
to have him go to the tailor&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Now, she did not know that Mr. Frog
had moved. She thought his shop was
on the banks of Broad Brook. But that
was just another mistake of hers. And if
she had known where his tailoring parlors
were then located, she would certainly
have raised a good many objections to
Rusty&rsquo;s visiting them on the day of his
cousin&rsquo;s party. For Mr. Frog&rsquo;s shop was
on the banks of Black Creek, where Long
Bill Wren spent his summers.</p>

<h2>THE FORGOTTEN GUEST</h2>


<p>The shadows were lengthening&mdash;for the
sun was far over in the west&mdash;when
Rusty Wren reached Mr. Frog&rsquo;s tailor&rsquo;s
shop overlooking Black Creek. Rusty
pushed open the door and stepped inside,
expecting to find Mr. Frog sitting cross-legged
upon his table and sewing busily,
according to the tailor&rsquo;s custom, until
sunset, which marked the close of Mr.
Frog&rsquo;s working day.</p>

<p>But Rusty had hardly entered the shop
when he bumped into Mr. Frog with a
crash; for Mr. Frog had been hurrying
toward the door.</p>

<p>The collision bowled them both over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
upon the floor. But Mr. Frog did not appear
annoyed in the least.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How-dy do!&rdquo; he said, almost before
he had picked himself up. &ldquo;If you have
come to see me on business, I&rsquo;m sorry to
say that I can&rsquo;t do anything for you to-day....
The fact is, I&rsquo;m going to a singing-party
this evening. And I don&rsquo;t want
to be late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to a party, too!&rdquo;
Rusty Wren exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken&mdash;for there&rsquo;s to
be no party here,&rdquo; Mr. Frog told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! The party I&rsquo;m going to will be
held somewhere else,&rdquo; Rusty Wren explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting,&rdquo; said Mr. Frog, as
he settled his hat more firmly upon his
queerly shaped head. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s having it&mdash;if
I may ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rusty Wren looked at the tailor as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
he were much surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know about it?&rdquo; he inquired.
&ldquo;Do you mean to say that my
cousin, Long Bill Wren, didn&rsquo;t invite
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Mr. Frog appeared
somewhat taken aback.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have forgotten me,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard a word about
his party before.... But I know it&rsquo;s a
mistake,&rdquo; he added, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt!&rdquo; said Rusty Wren politely.
&ldquo;I was going to Cousin Bill&rsquo;s home as
soon as you had measured me for a new
Sunday coat,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come right along now!&rdquo; Mr.
Frog cried heartily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go together.
For I&rsquo;m sure that Long Bill didn&rsquo;t mean
to forget me. You know we&rsquo;re the best
of friends. I make all his clothes for him;
and he has never yet paid me a penny.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Rusty Wren hesitated. He was not
quite sure that his cousin had intended to
invite the nimble tailor to his party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your singing-party!&rdquo; he reminded
Mr. Frog. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to
miss that!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog caught him by a wing and
laughed gaily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! That doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he remarked
with a careless air. &ldquo;We have a
singing-party almost every night. I&rsquo;d
much rather go to your cousin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is not strange that Rusty Wren
should feel a little uncomfortable at the
prospect of arriving at a party with a
person who had received no invitation to
it. But he could think of no way of ridding
himself of Mr. Frog&rsquo;s company. So
the two started off together towards the
home of Long Bill Wren.</p>

<p>Rusty decided, however, that he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
take his cousin to one side and explain
to him in private how the tailor had happened
to come with him.</p>

<p>But he soon found that no such explanation
was necessary. For a certain reason,
Long Bill Wren was in no wise annoyed.
On the contrary, he seemed quite
pleased.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII</h2>

<h2>A STRANGE MISTAKE</h2>


<p>Not wishing to be late at his cousin&rsquo;s
party, which he understood was to begin
at five o&rsquo;clock, Rusty Wren hurried along
the bank of Black Creek, while Mr. Frog
did his best to keep pace with him.</p>

<p>Somewhat out of breath, the two arrived
shortly at the home of Long Bill
Wren. And, to their surprise, they saw
not the least sign of any other guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we were the first to get
here,&rdquo; Rusty Wren remarked, as they
drew near Long Bill&rsquo;s house in the reeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody has to be first, you
know,&rdquo; the tailor observed easily. &ldquo;I always
like to be early at a party,&rdquo; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
added, &ldquo;because then I am sure of getting
plenty of refreshments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If there were no other guests to be seen,
neither was there any indication of a
party about Long Bill&rsquo;s home. There was
nothing to eat anywhere in sight; and no
flag, nor gay Chinese lantern, nor decoration
of any other kind adorned his
house.</p>

<p>Rusty Wren had always thought his
cousin&rsquo;s house a strange dwelling. Made
of coarse grasses and reed stalks, it was
round, like a big ball, with a doorway in
one side. This queer building was fastened
among the reeds a little distance
above the ground. And it seemed to Rusty
Wren that it must be a damp and unhealthful
place to live.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd that your cousin&rsquo;s not here
to greet us,&rdquo; Mr. Frog croaked.</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
large mouth when Long Bill thrust his
head and shoulders out of his door&mdash;for
he had heard the voices in his front yard.
He had on a shocking old coat&mdash;not at all
the sort one would choose to wear when
one expected guests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
to see you, Cousin Rusty. And I&rsquo;m certainly
surprised, for it&rsquo;s more than a year
since you&rsquo;ve paid me a visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad to see me, too?&rdquo; Mr.
Frog piped up a bit anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;to be sure!&rdquo; said Long
Bill. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not so surprised&mdash;though
I understand that you usually attend a
singing-party about this time o&rsquo; day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Mr. Frog. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d much
prefer to come to yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My what?&rdquo; inquired Long Bill Wren,
as a puzzled look appeared upon his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your party, of course!&rdquo; Mr. Frog replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
with a wide smile.</p>

<p>Now, Rusty Wren wished he had not
called at Mr. Frog&rsquo;s shop at all. If he had
only come straight to his cousin&rsquo;s house,
he thought that he would have spared himself&mdash;and
his cousin, too&mdash;a good deal of
trouble. And, since he didn&rsquo;t know what
to say, he kept still for a few moments
and let the others do all the talking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Long Bill hopped briskly
outside his house, and joined them on the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My party!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, I know
of no party here! Somebody has made a
mistake. I haven&rsquo;t given a party for a
year&mdash;just a year ago to-day.... I invited
you at that time,&rdquo; he told Rusty
Wren, &ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t come. And I never
received any word from you about the
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; said Rusty. &ldquo;This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is the first I ever heard of the affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I engaged Mr. Crow to take your invitation
to Jolly Robin in the orchard and
ask him to give it to you,&rdquo; Long Bill informed
his bewildered cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way this invitation
reached me yesterday!&rdquo; Rusty explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I see it all now,&rdquo; said Long Bill.
And he began to laugh merrily. &ldquo;Mr.
Crow&rsquo;s poor memory is to blame for your
mistake. He forgot to deliver the message
last year. And he happened to remember
it only yesterday. So the news
reached you just twelve months too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although Long Bill Wren continued to
laugh heartily, neither Mr. Frog nor
Rusty could manage even a faint smile.
Having expected a merry time and plenty
to eat, they were both disappointed.</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog soon said that so far as
he was concerned, he still had a singing-party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that he could attend, so he didn&rsquo;t
feel sad very long. And, after all, Rusty
was glad to see his cousin, Long Bill
Wren. They had a pleasant chat together
for almost an hour. And Long Bill
invited Rusty to stay to dinner.</p>

<p>Rusty thanked him and said, no! he
must hasten home, because he had to go
to bed early, on account of having to
awaken Farmer Green at dawn the next
morning.</p>

<p>When he returned to the old cherry tree
Rusty had to answer a good many questions.
His wife wanted to know what had
kept him so long, and what Mr. Frog said,
and what color his new Sunday coat was
going to be.</p>

<p>When she learned that her husband&rsquo;s
visit to the tailor had been all in vain, she
looked very suspicious and said quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been at a party, have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; Rusty Wren replied. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t gone to a party for more than a
year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he seemed quite indignant that his
wife should have such a strange idea in
her head.</p>
